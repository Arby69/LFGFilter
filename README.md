# LFGFilter
WoW-Addon that makes LFG and LFM requests in public chats more visible.

Release version is currently only for WoW Classic (Vanilla + TBC + WotLK).

Localization needed for any client locales. enUS and deDE are quite complete, perhaps some dungeon patterns for enUS could be completed.

What is needed for localization?
- localized name of the dungeon/raid
- some localized search patterns by which a dungeon can be recognized (eg. "MT" for manatomb in english or "TM" for Todesminen/Deathmines in german).
